# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Healthcare-Reviews
**Project Overview**
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on healthcare-related reviews. The goal is to automatically categorize the sentiment of reviews (positive, neutral, or negative) to gain insights into patient feedback and healthcare service quality.
Sentiment analysis can be a valuable tool for healthcare providers, helping them understand patient satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and ultimately enhance the quality of care.

**Data**
The dataset used for this project contains healthcare reviews from various sources such as hospitals, clinics, or medical practices. Each review is accompanied by a sentiment label that indicates whether the review is positive, neutral, or negative.
